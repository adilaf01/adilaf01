# Hey there! 👋

I'm on a quest to unravel the mysteries of technology, creativity, and the art of storytelling, one line of code, one brushstroke, and one frame at a time. If there's a word that defines me, it's **curious**. I'm that student who's never done learning, that creative soul who's always wondering "why" and "how", and that filmmaker who believes every frame has a story to tell.
